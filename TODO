This file keeps notes on RSX refresher work until I opened repository. Mostly history, might be usefull.

1. Log WriteLevelData and Sys_ChangeWorkingDirectory need testing on PS3
v 2. Code clean up
v 3. Sound
v 4. Remove doubling rsxutil.c

[x] Fully complete Mod_LoadFaces
[x] and then RecursiveWorldNode

[x] 3D DLM shaders wrappers


[x] DepthTest not working 
[x] SkyBox wrong texture
[x] Lightmap shaders not working right:
    [x] Vertex: fails at state self check
    [x] Fragment: Lightmaps seems to be empty

[x] Flowing lightmap shaders
Regorganize shaders code
[x] Regorganize texture code (texture filtering accodrding to state used in bind)
[x] Dynamic Lights

14.03
[x] buffer rsx mesh calls
[x] Enemies rotation seems to be wrong
[x] draw_brush_model - positioning broken, can be seen in first door at outerbase
[x] rsx_surf: alpha surface positioning broken, can be seen with window (lack of it) at outerbase shader loading error?


15.03
[x]draw_alias_model: z-buffering (or how it called in quake 2) for transparent rendering, smoke effects seen through walls
	I was toggling rsxSetDepthTestEnable (entire work of depth test) instead of rsxSetDepthWriteEnable (writing to detpth buffer)

16.03
[x] Complete particle shaders (non square):
	- [x] pass to vertex shader particles screen dimensions
	- [x] take code after return in fragment particles shader to separate shader
	- [x] remove unnecessary stuff from fragment particles squared shader
[x]	alpha surfaces - no textures, not alpha (lol)
	passed pointer's address instead of pointer itself in fragment 3d shader init

17.03
[x] Complete water rendering
NOTE: I think that's it. HW renderer draws everything I expect to see.
But there is still some parts of code that I haven't done. Marked them in this TODO for
further work.
Also make logging on rsx memory allocation and free'ing:
Things much better then I expected! Only missed some free's of fragment shaders and
allocated lightmap buffers way too many times. Now it seems renderer have not memory
leaks (at least in rsx's memory segment)
but it looks like hunk allocator having memory leak on every level loading around 11 MiB.

18.03
[x] free fragment alias memory
[x] free fragment particles memory
[x] fragmentSrc3Dcolor
[x] GL3_DrawBeam
[x] Sound Clear now working

19.03 and 20.03
NOTE: Changes to Makefile. Prebuild pkg.py utility for Linux and Windows both x64.
added prepkg build target for creating zip arhive with mentioned utility and 
crete_pkg scripts  for users themselfes create packages with pack*.pak music 
etc in baseq2. Now game running from QUAKE2_00 folder b/c requirements of 9 chars
for game folders  

21.03
[x] fragmentSrcAliasColor
[x] GL3_DrawAliasShadows (dont have stencil buffer)
[x] looks like hunk allocator having memory leak on every level loading around 11 MiB
	memory leak was different size, but still taken place due to missed Mod_FreeAll 
NOTE: Started reviewing code and switching to R_RSX_<[P/p]ascalCase> naming for
rsx renderer function. Spotted some perfomance wise weak places marked them, if 
perfomance on real hardware will be underwhelming it is the first places to look for.
After resolving memory leak issue kept game running for a bit more than a hour at
demo levels. No crashes, no glitches - I consider it "stable enough" for a current
state of project.

22.03
[x] Cant start on real hardware
	summarized all causes and issues in TODOs

23.03 (early morning)
[x] 3D drawing causes currsed things if dist ~0 can be seen in weapon model and world drawing completly broken
	it had something with vertex outside of ViewPort
	Disabled sky for testing.
	The issue was indeed in ViewPort: I incorrectly setup it at RSX and further broke R_MYgluPerspective to fix
	incorrect ViewPort (it all was back in august). Also RPCS3 viewport polygon clipping works not like on
	real hardware which resulting in normal looking picture. I mean, I have ViewPort seted rotated up (rsxSetViewPort)
	and then rotated projection matrix down to see correct things, but RSX tried to cut them off or something leading
	to some scary geometry glitches.
NOTE (sidenote): Figure out'ing this took me entire day and I lost my sleep. I was really scared of project lock up on
	this and tilted.

23.03
[x] clean shaders froom all of those durty things you done to them to understand roots of ViewPort bug.
[x] rsx_gluPerspective => R_RSX_MYgluPerspective
[x] rsxMemalign_with_log was changed from macro to function, is it even needed now?
	returned to macro form, now it is drop in replacement to rsxMemalign without any fidling with ptr as arg
[x]	particles not working

24.03
[x] round particles broke
	see notes in src/client/refresh/ref_rsx/shaders/fragmentSrcParticles.fcg for details
[x] R_RSX_Light_PushDynLights crashes everything
	reason: W32_Z32_Y32_X32 texture format
	reimplemented dynamic lightys pos col intensity pass to shaders by uniforms this made
	fragment shader 3d lightmap way bigger.
[x] shaders error: practical intensity of dynamic light affected by pixel distance from near plane
	done temporary solution see notes in src/client/refresh/ref_rsx/shaders/fragmentSrc3Dlm.fcg 

25.03
NOTE: Started reworking shader wrapping code

26.03
[x] Also world drawing causes significant slowdown probably beacause of ViewPort bug accurences or amount of drawcalls
		World drawing slow even with bug fixed. i.e. perfomance on RPCS3 on my laptop is on pair with real hardware.
		So now my guess is amount of drawcalls or RecursiveWorldNode.
		Issue is in heavy shader loading, have to rewrite behaviour of shader's const/atribs setting and shader loading
NOTE: Complete rework of shaders code. Perfomance improved but not as much as I wish it will.

28.03
[x]	remove code related to old R_RSX_Light_PushDynLights implementation

TODO:

Clean local.h from OpenGL3 leftovers
Clean model.h from OpenGL3 leftovers


Brush Models (doors, buttons, vents) having trouble rendering 
	wooow it is a serious issue happening because rare constants (overbrightbits and scroll) in other (but not all)
	shaders somehow affecting model matrix of vs3dlm shader but not predictable in any way.
	Maybe I still dont understand how constants in cg shaders works
	Exact conflicts:
		3D Vertex Flow          - scroll
		3D Vertex Lightmap Flow - scroll
		3D Vertex Alias         - overbrightbits

rsxSetZMinMaxControl now commented out for same reasons why shader code is flooded but which params do it really needed?
	old ones was 0, 1, 1

Real hardware errors:
	
	

[] GL3_DrawSpriteModel (just NOTE)
[] complete work of Lightflags in fragmentSrc3DlmNoColor and fragmentSrc3Dlm (fragmentSrc3Dlm seems to had it partially)
[] Shadows drawn to display buffer (resulting in seeing parts of model shadows overlaping) 
	have to use stencil buffer. By default r_shadows is 0 and gl3state.stencil is false. 
	Also! Shadows in this state is more like original Quake 2's OpenGL shadows but rotated
	to closest light source.



OTHER:
Image Free sequence - I think it's working havent marked then done on it
NOTE: Reloading renderer causes issues

[x] Sky had cliping problem can be seen at base2 looking at sky near capsule wings.
	Seems like brush model rendering fixed it. 
	It means Quake 2 crops skybox and draws still visible leftovers as separate models. Cool! But wastefull tho...
